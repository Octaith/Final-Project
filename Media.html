                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>I was first introduced to this game by a good friend of mine who I called James. I never knew the simple question of "Do you want to play Halo?" would make such a big impact on my life.</p>
                        <h1>Childhood</h1>
                        <p>Halo 2 was the game James and I played. Once I started playing cooperative mode with him, I instantly got hooked. It was a feeling that I never got from a video game before. At times I would ask if it was okay to go over to his house just to play that game due to lack of Xbox at the time in my house (Sorry James). I loved every bit of it the story, gameplay, and the ability to play split-screen. Luckiy for me I got hooked at just the right time because the Xbox 360 was going to be released soon and James was generous enough to give me hix old Xbox after he got his Xbox 360. I was ecstatic and really thanked him, but of course I needed to get my own copy of Halo which I eventually did after some persuasion of my parents.</p>
